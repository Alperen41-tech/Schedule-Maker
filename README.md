# Schedule-Maker
A desktop application developed by me (Written in Python).
My purpose was to create an app that generates every possible schedule a student may have
according to given course information such as course code, instructor name etc. This application
eliminates the need of the people to spend time calculating which courses that they can take.
Requirements: Calculating possibilities for each combination of courses. Properly reading, writing,
and managing Excel files to create a successful and colorful template.
